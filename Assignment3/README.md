Assignment 3.1: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Implement a basic RAG pipeline. Create a RAG by crawling a given website link. Evaluate the
performance of your RAG system on a question-answering dataset (e.g., Natural Questions or
TriviaQA).

Assignment 3.2: Agent and Multi-Agent Systems
Design a simple multi-agent LLM system where each agent is responsible for a subtask (e.g.,
planning, summarizing, answering). Implement communication between agents using message
passing or shared memory.

Assignment 3.3: Fine-Tuning and Parameter-Efficient Methods
Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer on a classification task (e.g., sentiment analysis or intent classification). Analyze the trade-offs between accuracy, training time, and memory usage for different fine-tuning techniques.
